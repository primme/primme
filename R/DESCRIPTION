Description:
    R interface to PRIMME, a C library for computing a few
    eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of a real symmetric or complex
    Hermitian matrix, or generalized Hermitian eigenproblem.  It can also compute
    singular values and vectors of a square or rectangular matrix.  It can find
    largest, smallest, or interior singular/eigenvalues and can use preconditioning
    to accelerate convergence.
